# -Nueral_Network_classification
Hello,
Today let's look at how we can approach a classification neural network problem.

To begin with, what exactly is a classification problem?
In a classification problem, you attempt to determine whether something belongs to one category or another.

For example-

-> It is a process or task of classification, in which a given data is being classified into two classes. It’s basically a kind of prediction about which of two groups the thing belongs to.
Predict whether or not someone has heart disease based on their health parameters. This is called binary classification since there are only two options.

-> Multi-class classification is the task of classifying elements into different classes. Unlike binary, it doesn’t restrict itself to any number of classes. 
 
Examples of multi-class classification are -
- classification of news in different categories, 
- classifying books according to the subject, 
- classifying students according to their streams etc.
- Decide whether a photo of is of food, a person, or a dog. This is called multi-class classification since there are more than two options.

-> Predict what categories should be assigned to a Wikipedia article. This is called multi-label classification since a single article could have more than one category assigned.

Please find my notes here, I hope they can help you. They aren't the whole thing, but I will upload the second part after a certain amount of time.
